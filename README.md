# Node2Vec on Hi-C: Detecting Chromosome Translocations with Network Analysis ðŸ§¬
## Introduction
In the realm of genomics, unraveling the intricacies of chromosome translocations holds paramount importance, particularly in the context of understanding genetic diseases, such as cancer. This repository introduces a simple and intuitive framework that combines graph theory and machine learning to detect translocation, given an Hi-C input data.

This repository is not designed as a genomic data analysis library. Instead, it relies on the [Node2Vec](https://github.com/eliorc/node2vec) and [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) libraries, saving you time on the data engineering part. Think of it as a tool tailored for visualizing genomic translocations when you have both a metadata file and Hi-C data at your disposal.

The repository is composed by different folders:
* [data](https://github.com/keivan-amini/Node2Vec-Hi-C/tree/main/data) contains Hi-C data and Metadata file.
* [scripts](https://github.com/keivan-amini/Node2Vec-Hi-C/tree/main/scripts) contains all python modules useed in the project.
* [model](https://github.com/keivan-amini/Node2Vec-Hi-C/tree/main/model) contains the outputs embeddings from the Node2Vec algorithm.
* [plot](https://github.com/keivan-amini/Node2Vec-Hi-C/tree/main/plot) contains the plotted figures.
* [tutorial](https://github.com/keivan-amini/Node2Vec-Hi-C/tree/main/tutorial) contains an easy how-to notebook exploiting this repository. TODO
* [tests](https://github.com/keivan-amini/Node2Vec-Hi-C/tree/main/tests) contains tests for the scripts. TODO
* [pdf](https://github.com/keivan-amini/Node2Vec-Hi-C/tree/main/pdf) contains the full project documentation, with mathematical theory, figures and results.


## Requirements
### Data requirements
* an Hi-C data in .csv that will be interpreted as an adjacency matrix of a graph:

      0      31495  12592  8465   5828   ...
      31495  0      55588  32895  21299  ...
      12592  55588  0      57642  32376  ...
      8465   32895  57642  0      42695  ...
      5828   21299  32376  42695  0      ...
      ...    ...    ...    ...    ...    ...


* a Metadata file in .csv or in .xlsx, .xls that gives informations about nodes of the graph and the related chromosome:

    |   chr |   start |   end |
    |-------|---------|-------|
    |  chr1 |       1 |   250 |
    |  chr6 |     251 |   422 |
    |   ... |     ... |   ... |
